# SearchGTP Firefox Addon

This is the smallest footprint Firefox Addon for adding ChatGPT's search to Firefox as a search provider. By doing so, you are able to optionally make it your default search provider.

## Installation

Because you are grabbing this from GitHub, you are not getting a nicely signed first class Firefox Addon. As someone looking for this on GitHub, I am making the assumption you understand that you are loading this locally, and are just happy to have this, as I was when ChatGPT helped me put this together (which is why the license is MIT by the way - have fun with this).

In firefox, enter `about:debugging` into your address bar. Then, on the sidebar, click "This Firefox". Under "Temporary Addons" is a button labeled "Load Temporary Addon". Navigate to the directory, and select the manifest.json directly.

Now, go to your Firefox Settings > Search, and you will see "ChatGPT" as a Search Provider. From here, you can make it your default search provider.

## Warranties

None, this is a simple json file. I make no claims that chatgpt is secure, nor that it isn't owned by aliens or other species predatory to mankind. This is simply some wiring I found useful and I share hoping you find the same.
